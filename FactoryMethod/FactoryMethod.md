Creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classesâ€”rather than by calling a constructor.


The Factory Method pattern abstracts the decision-making process from the calling class.

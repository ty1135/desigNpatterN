The Flyweight pattern describes how to share objects to allow their use at fine granularity without prohibitive cost. Each "flyweight" object is divided into two pieces: the state-dependent (extrinsic) part, and the state-independent (intrinsic) part. Intrinsic state is stored (shared) in the Flyweight object. Extrinsic state is stored or computed by client objects, and passed to the Flyweight when its operations are invoked.
